# GoAwayGo — Web Frontend

The web version of the GoAwayGo travel app. It is a React + TypeScript single-page app that mirrors
the Flutter app in `../app_frontend` screen by screen. Brand colours, copy, routes and API calls
match the app. The layout is responsive, from 360px phones up to desktop.

## Getting started

Requires **Node 22.12+** (Node 24 LTS recommended — see `.nvmrc`). `.npmrc` sets
`engine-strict=true`, so `npm install` refuses older Node versions instead of warning.

```bash
cd web_frontend
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in the values below
npm install
npm run dev               # http://localhost:5173
```

| Script                            | What it does                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                     | Dev server with HMR                                              |
| `npm run dev:dev-api`             | Dev server using the dev API (no local backend; signed out only) |
| `npm run build`                   | Type-check (`tsc -b`) and production build into `dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`                 | Serve the production build locally                               |
| `npm run typecheck`               | TypeScript only                                                  |
| `npm run lint`                    | ESLint                                                           |
| `npm run format` / `format:check` | Prettier                                                         |
| `npm run check`                   | typecheck + lint + format check + build (run before every PR)    |

### Environment variables

All values are public build-time config (they end up in the JS bundle). Never put secrets here.

| Variable                | Purpose                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`     | Origin of the Spring Boot backend, no trailing slash, e.g. `http://localhost:8080`. Empty means same origin.                    |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth **web** client ID. If empty, the "Continue with Google" button is hidden. Unlike the app, the page does not crash. |

`.env.example` is pre-filled with the local backend URL and the project's (public) Web client ID.

The backend must allow CORS from the web origin, for example `http://localhost:5173` in development, and needs
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in its own `.env` for Google sign-in (see the backend README).

The 4-tab bar is a bottom tab bar under 768px and a sticky top bar on wider screens.

## Languages and currencies (4.7)

English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Arabic (right to left) and Japanese. Text is written in English and
wrapped in `t('English sentence {0}', value)` from `@/lib/i18n`; `src/lib/i18n/messages/<code>.json` holds the
translations (the same files as the app). After adding or changing text, run `node scripts/i18n-keys.mjs` and add
the new sentences to every messages file: `npm run check` fails while one is missing (`npm run i18n:check`).

- The language: the visitor's choice (Profile tab), else the browser's, else English. Every API request sends it as
  `Accept-Language`, and a signed-in account follows it (its pushes and emails).
- Dates, numbers and prices use the browser's locale for that language (`getLocale()`).
- Prices: the account's currency, else the visitor's choice (Profile tab), else a guess from the browser's region.
- Use logical CSS properties (`margin-inline-start`, `inset-inline-end`, `text-align: start`) so Arabic mirrors.
- Legal pages stay in English.

```

Conventions: kebab-case or lowercase feature folders, PascalCase component files with a sibling
`*.module.css`, camelCase hooks and utils, and an `index.ts` barrel per feature exposing only its
pages. Colours, spacing, radii, sizes and durations come from `tokens.css`. Components never
hardcode a hex value or a magic size.

## Data and API layer

`src/lib/apiClient.ts` is the only place that calls `fetch` for API requests. It reads error messages in one
place (`message` → `error` → fallback, plus the machine-readable `error` code) and turns network failures into
`ApiError('Unable to connect to server.', 0)`.

| Call                   | Endpoint                                        | Success                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `signUp`               | `POST /api/auth/signup` `{name,email,password}` | 201                          |
| `signIn`               | `POST /api/auth/signin` `{email,password}`      | 200 session + refresh cookie |
| `signInWithGoogleCode` | `POST /api/auth/google-signin/code` `{code}`    | 200 session + refresh cookie |
| `restoreSession`       | `POST /api/auth/refresh` (refresh cookie)       | 200 session, or 401          |
| `signOut`              | `POST /api/auth/logout` (refresh cookie)        | 204                          |
| `requestPasswordReset` | `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` `{email}`      | 2xx _(backend: next PR)_     |

Discover (4.1, `src/features/discover`): `suggestPlaces` (`GET /api/discover/places`), `getDestination`
(`GET /api/discover/destination`), `getRecentSearches` (`GET /api/discover/recent`), `getPhotosFor`
(`POST /api/discover/photos`, for searches kept on the device when signed out), `getTripIdeas`
(`GET /api/discover/ideas`), and My Trips (`/api/me/saved-places`). How the backend builds them:
`backend/**Discover: destination pages, photos and ideas** (backend README).

The user travels snake_case on the wire (`UserDto`) and camelCase in the app (`User`), converted in
`src/types/user.ts`.

### Authentication (`src/lib/session.ts`)

- **Access token** (20 min): kept **in memory only** and sent as `Authorization: Bearer`. Never in
  `localStorage`, where an injected script could read it.
- **Refresh token** (30 days): an **HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie** set by the backend on
  `/api/auth`. JavaScript can't read it; requests use `credentials: 'include'`.
- **Page load:** the session is restored with one `POST /api/auth/refresh`. `SessionGate` holds rendering until
  then, so every page knows from its first render whether someone is signed in. Nothing about the user is stored
  in the browser (an old `user` key from earlier versions is removed).
- **Expiry:** a 401 on an authenticated request triggers one refresh and a retry; if the refresh fails the user
  is signed out.
- **No overlapping refreshes.** The backend rotates refresh tokens and treats reuse of an old one as theft
  (it revokes the session). Concurrent callers in a tab share one request, and the Web Locks API serialises
  tabs, so a second tab refreshes with the cookie the first one just received.
- **Sign out** asks for confirmation, then revokes the session on the server (`/api/auth/logout`).

### Google sign-in

The "CONTINUE WITH GOOGLE" button is **our own `Button`** (variant `google`: same type and shape as every other
button, white with dark text and Google's four-colour G). Clicking it opens Google's popup through the
**OAuth 2.0 code client** (Google Identity Services), which returns a one-time authorization code. The code is
sent to the backend, which exchanges it with Google using the client secret, so no secret or ID token is
handled in the browser. A random `state` is sent with each request and must come back unchanged. If the browser
blocks the popup, the user is asked to allow pop-ups.

## Differences from the Flutter app (deliberate)

- **No duplicated widgets.** The app has three copies each of the input field, date-picker util
  and form-controller util (`flight_*`, `hotel_*`, `rentals_*`). It also has two copies of
  `AuthButton` and `FeatureItem`, and identical `CategoryButton` / `ProfileButton` widgets. Here
  they are a single `FieldShell`-based field family, one `Button`, one `FeatureList` and one
  `IconTile`, shared through `src/components`. The three booking screens share `SearchFormLayout`.
- **Missing config doesn't crash.** The app throws on a missing `.env`. Here, a missing API URL
  falls back to same-origin, and a missing Google client ID hides the Google button.
- **Real sessions instead of a stored user.** The app stores the user and "verifies" it by id. Here the
  session is restored from an HttpOnly refresh cookie and every request carries a short-lived token
  (see _Authentication_).
- **Forgot password only asks for the email.** A reset link will be emailed; the reply never reveals whether
  an account exists. The app's form sets a new password directly, which would let anyone take over an account.
- **User Profile shows real data or "Not set".** The app hardcodes demo values for every row.
  Email, Display Name and Phone come from the signed-in user. Country / Region and Currency show
  "Not set" because the backend has no such fields yet.
- **Sign Out works.** In the app it is an empty handler. Here it asks for confirmation, revokes the session on
  the server and returns to `/auth`. A sign-out icon also sits in the Profile header.
- **Google sign-in uses our own button** in the app's button style (authorization-code flow, see above).
- Date fields use the browser's native date picker, with a dark colour scheme, limited to
  today → +365 days. Values are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Stubs and placeholders (not implemented on purpose)

| What                                                    | Where                                        | Status                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notifications bell                                      | —                                            | Visibly disabled ("coming soon"). Empty handlers in the app                  |
| Profile tiles: Recently Viewed, Saved, Reviews, Rewards | `features/profile/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`     | Visibly disabled ("Coming soon"). My Trips and User Profile are wired        |
| Password reset email                                    | `features/auth/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` | The form is final; the backend endpoint arrives with the email-provider work |

## Accessibility and motion

- Real `<button>` / `<a>` elements, labelled inputs (visually hidden labels where the design uses
  placeholders), and visible focus rings on everything.
- Dialogs use the native `<dialog>`: focus is trapped and Esc closes them. They also auto-dismiss
  after 3s like the app.
- Choice chips are radio inputs. Wanderbook tabs follow the WAI-ARIA tabs pattern (arrow keys).
- **Navigation motion** (`src/app/layouts/usePageMotion.ts`): switching tabs glides in from the side of the tab
  you came from; pages opened from a page come in from the right, Back from the left; pages over the tabs slide all
  the way, like the app's panels. The active tab's indicator grows in and its icon pops.
- **Photo morphs** (`MorphLink` + matching CSS `view-transition-name`): a post's grid tile or feed photo grows into the
  post page, and a person's photo in a list moves into their profile header. The link passes what it already shows
  (`state.preview`), so the next page can draw that photo at once. Browsers without View Transitions just navigate.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` turns off the splash bounce, the wave, the slide-ins, page motion, photo morphs, the
  carousel scaling and the Wanderbook header collapse.
- Buttons: `Button` and `ButtonLink` (a link that looks like a button), `size="sm"` for compact actions and
  `variant="outline"` for secondary ones. Don't style buttons per page.

## Deployment

The website is a static build (`npm run build` → `dist/`) hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**, one project per
environment, uploaded by GitHub Actions (Direct Upload: Cloudflare doesn't build anything). The backend's setup is in
the backend README (**Deployment**); how a version moves up is in **Releasing** (README).

| Environment | Gets                                    | Pages project       | Address                        | API                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| dev         | every version (Release)                 | `goawaygo-web-dev`  | `dev.goawaygo.com`             | `https://api-dev.goawaygo.com`  |
| test        | a version from dev (Controller, owner)  | `goawaygo-web-test` | `test.goawaygo.com`            | `https://api-test.goawaygo.com` |
| prod        | a version from test (Controller, owner) | `goawaygo-web-prod` | `goawaygo.com` (+ `www` → 301) | `https://api.goawaygo.com`      |

These three are the only website addresses (`www.goawaygo.com` is a Redirect Rule to `goawaygo.com`). The pre-launch
`staging.goawaygo.com` was deleted on 14 Nov 2026.

The website and API must stay on the same registrable domain (`goawaygo.com`): the login refresh cookie is
`SameSite=Strict`.

### How it works

- **One build for every environment.** Release (`release.yml`) builds each version once and attaches the zip to its
  GitHub Release; `deploy.yml` uploads that same zip to the environment's Pages project. The API address and the
  environment's name come from the address the site is served at (`src/lib/env.ts`), so nothing is baked in per
  environment.
- **prod only:** the deploy also pre-renders the 50 destination pages from prod's data
  (`scripts/prerender-destinations.mjs`, about 50 minutes) and uploads again with them and the full sitemap.
- Pages serves `index.html` for any unknown path (there is no `404.html`), so React Router handles deep links such
  as `/reset-password?token=…`.
- [`public/_headers`](public/_headers) adds security headers, long-term caching for hashed assets and
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` everywhere except `goawaygo.com`.
- Node version comes from `.nvmrc`.

### GitHub settings

- Repository secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Cloudflare token "GitHub Pages deploy": Account → Cloudflare Pages →
  Edit, nothing else) and variable `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- Environments `dev`, `test`, `prod`, each with `PAGES_PROJECT` and `WEB_URL` (the table above). test and prod need
  the owner's approval.
- Repository variable `PROD_WEB_URL` = `https://goawaygo.com` (the prod smoke tests).
- Repository secrets `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`: the Cloudflare Access service token for the
  team-only dev and test websites (below). Used by the deploy smoke test and the website tests in dev and test only.

### Team-only dev and test (Cloudflare Access)

The dev and test websites are **team only** (Cloudflare Access, MVP 2): a browser must enter a one-time code sent to
the team Gmail. Test runs get through with the Access service token "goawaygo-tests (dev and test websites)"
(Cloudflare Zero Trust → Access controls → Service credentials; valid 1 year, until 2027-11-14): GitHub secrets
`CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` of the website repo, sent only to our website (headers
`CF-Access-Client-Id`, `CF-Access-Client-Secret`) and never in prod. Renew the token before it expires: create a new
one, put it in both secrets and the Access application's "Test runs (service token)" policy, then delete the old one.

The Access application "GoAwayGo dev and test websites" (Zero Trust Free, team `polished-tree-eaa7`) covers
`dev.goawaygo.com`, `test.goawaygo.com`, `goawaygo-web-dev.pages.dev`, `goawaygo-web-test.pages.dev` and their
preview addresses (`*.goawaygo-web-dev.pages.dev`, `*.goawaygo-web-test.pages.dev`). Policies: "Team only" (Allow,
email = the team Gmail, one-time code) and "Test runs (service token)" (Service Auth). `goawaygo.com` stays public.
The backend adds the second lock: only the team Gmail can sign in on dev and test (`TEAM_ONLY_EMAILS`). To give
someone access later: add their email to the "Team only" policy and to the backend's `TEAM_ONLY_EMAILS`.

### Setting up an environment (once)

1. Cloudflare → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Upload assets** (Direct Upload), project name from the table.
   Upload anything once (the first deploy replaces it).
2. **Custom domains → Set up a custom domain** → the address from the table (Cloudflare adds the DNS record).
3. Google sign-in: Google Cloud project `goaway-483709` → Google Auth Platform → Clients → **Goaway Web** → add the
   address to **Authorised JavaScript origins**.
4. The GitHub environment with `PAGES_PROJECT` and `WEB_URL`; the backend's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for that
   environment includes the address.

### Rollback

Actions → **Controller** → Run workflow on `main` (prod) or `test`, with an earlier version that passed there
(**Releasing** (README)). In an emergency: Workers & Pages → the environment's project → Deployments → an earlier deployment →
**Rollback to this deployment**.

## Releasing

What happens after a merge to `develop`, and how to publish a new Android build. Applies to all three repos
(`goawaygo_backend`, `goawaygo_web_frontend`, `goawaygo_app_frontend`). Setup details: each repo's `docs/`.

### After every merge to `develop`

Every merge whose CI passes becomes a **version** (MVP 2, 5.2): a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag and a GitHub Release
(a pre-release until it reaches production) listing the merged PRs. The PR title decides the number: `feat:` → minor,
`fix:` and everything else → patch, `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` → major (`.github/scripts/next-version.sh`). Each
repo has its own versions; all three started at `v1.5.0` (MVP 1).

| Part        | You do                                | Happens automatically                                                                                                                                 | Check                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend     | Nothing                               | CI tests → version → image built once (tagged with the version) → deployed to **dev** (`api-dev.goawaygo.com`) → smoke test; Flyway migrates (~6 min) | GitHub → goawaygo_backend → Actions → **Release** ✅      |
| Website     | Nothing                               | CI → version → website built once, attached to the release, deployed to **dev** (`dev.goawaygo.com`) (**Release**)                                    | GitHub → goawaygo_web_frontend → Actions → **Release** ✅ |
| Android app | Release it (below) when worth testing | CI → version (**Release**). The APK is signed with the upload key that exists only on the release PC                                                  | `https://goawaygo.com/download` shows the new version     |

The app doesn't need a release after every merge: release at the end of a feature or when testers should try
something.

### Release a new Android build (~10 min)

Git Bash, one command per line:

```bash
cd /c/Users/priyesh/OneDrive/Desktop/Dev/Goaway/app_frontend
git switch develop
git pull
export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/Eclipse Adoptium/jdk-17.0.20.101-hotspot/bin"
bash scripts/release-android.sh 1.0.0 <next-build> "What changed in this version" --upload
```

- `<next-build>`: the last build number + 1. **It must always go up**, or phones refuse the update.
- Ends with `Live: https://goawaygo.com/download`. If it asks for Cloudflare, run
  `npx --yes wrangler@4.145.0 login` once and repeat.
- It refuses to run without the upload key (`android/key.properties`), so nothing debug-signed is ever published.
- Push notifications need the Firebase key on this PC: run `bash scripts/firebase-key.sh` once (gcloud signed in).
  Without it the script warns and that build has no push.
- Fails with `cannot find symbol ... Plugin` in `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java` (usually after a dependency
  update): an old partial build of that plugin is left on this PC. Run `flutter clean` and run the command again.

Then send it to the beta testers:

1. Firebase console → project **goaway-483709** → **App Distribution**.
2. Drag in `app_frontend/build/release/goawaygo-<version>-<build>-universal.apk`, paste the same notes.
3. Testers → group **public-beta** → **Distribute**.

Check `https://goawaygo.com/download`, then install it on a phone over the previous build.

#### Version numbers

| Change          | Example                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Every release   | build number +1, always    |
| Fixes           | keep the version (`1.0.0`) |
| New feature set | `1.1.0`                    |
| Big milestone   | `2.0.0`                    |

### Occasionally

| Situation                         | What to do                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New backend secret (API key etc.) | Stored with a hidden-input script into Google Secret Manager (`backend/scripts/gcp-secrets.sh`)                                                                                   |
| New website setting               | A change to `src/lib/env.ts` (one build serves every environment), merged like any other change                                                                                   |
| Database change                   | Nothing: Flyway migrates on deploy. Keep migrations additive so a rollback still works.                                                                                           |
| Broken in test or prod            | Roll back with **Controller** → Run workflow (above). Instant backend switch: `gcloud run services update-traffic <service> --region asia-southeast1 --to-revisions REVISION=100` |
| Website broken in prod (urgent)   | Cloudflare → goawaygo-web-prod → Deployments → earlier deployment → **Rollback**; then the Controller as above                                                                    |
| Bad app build                     | Release a fixed build with a higher build number; delete the bad files from R2 and purge their URLs in Cloudflare cache                                                           |

### Moving a version up: test, then prod (`controller.yaml`, MVP 2, 5.4)

dev gets every version automatically. test and prod get a version only through **Controller**
(`.github/workflows/controller.yaml` in each repo), with your approval twice: once for the merge, once for the deploy.

1. **To test:** a PR from `develop` into `test` (opened by the bot). You approve it; it's merged with a merge commit.
2. Controller starts on `test`. It picks the version whose files are exactly what `test` now holds, checks that the
   version passed dev (its GitHub Release shows **✅** for the dev deployment, **AT dev** and **PT dev**), then waits
   for you: Actions → **Controller** → the
   run → **Review deployments** → tick **test** → **Approve and deploy**.
3. The backend and website deploy that version's image and build to test (`api-test.goawaygo.com`,
   `test.goawaygo.com`) and check them. The app has nothing to deploy: the version is recorded as promoted.
4. The automation (AT) and performance (PT) tests run on test right after the deploy and write their result into the
   release; then test it yourself on test.
5. **To prod:** a PR from `test` into `main`, approved and merged the same way; Controller checks the version passed
   test (deployment, AT and PT), waits for your approval (**prod**), deploys, and makes the version the **latest full release** (no longer a
   pre-release). For the app, build the APK from that version (below).

Each step is written into the version's GitHub Release under **Deployments**, e.g.
`- **test**: ✅ deployed 2026-11-12 09:30 UTC · run`, so every release shows where it has run. If a version isn't
ready (Release on `develop` still running, or it failed below), Controller stops with the reason; fix it and re-run.

### Automated and performance tests (AT, PT; MVP 2, 5.5 and 5.6)

The tests live in their own repos, with the same branches and rules: **goawaygo_automation_tests** (API and website
with Playwright, the Android app with Maestro on an emulator) and **goawaygo_performance_tests** (API and website with
k6, the app's start-up time and scrolling). Each environment runs the tests from its own branch (dev: `develop`,
test: `test`, prod: `main`), so a test change is promoted like code.

| When                          | What runs                                                                    | Evidence                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| A pull request into `develop` | **Tests before merge**: the smoke tests against dev (app: built from the PR) | the report on the PR (not a required check) |
| After every deploy to dev     | **Release → Tests on dev**: all AT, and PT with limits that fail the run     | `AT dev` / `PT dev` ✅ or ❌ in the release |
| After a deploy to test        | **Controller → Tests on test**: the same                                     | `AT test` / `PT test` in the release        |
| After a deploy to prod        | **Controller → Tests on prod**: read-only smoke tests, never PT              | `AT prod` in the release                    |

A version goes to test only with ✅ for AT and PT in dev, and to prod only with ✅ for both in test. Every run keeps
its reports for 90 days: the run's page → **Artifacts** (Playwright HTML report, k6 HTML report, app screenshots and
timings). In dev and test the tests use the backend's fake outside services (no AI or partner quota is used) and skip
its rate limits; prod has neither. A failed run: open the report, fix the code or the test, and re-run (Actions →
the run → **Re-run failed jobs**); the release then shows the new result.

**Roll back or deploy again:** Actions → **Controller** → **Run workflow** → "Use workflow from" **main** (prod) or
**test** (test) → version, e.g. `v1.7.0` (empty = the branch's own version) → approve. Only a version that is merged
into that branch and passed the environment below can be deployed. Keep database migrations additive so an older
version still runs.

## How we work

These rules apply to all GoAwayGo repositories:
[app](https://github.com/goawaygoofficial/goawaygo_app_frontend) ·
[web](https://github.com/goawaygoofficial/goawaygo_web_frontend) ·
[backend](https://github.com/goawaygoofficial/goawaygo_backend).

### First-time setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enable the shared git hooks (once per clone)
```

The hooks:

- **pre-commit** scans staged changes for secrets with [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks).
  Install it once: `winget install Gitleaks.Gitleaks` (Windows) or `brew install gitleaks` (macOS).
  Without it, the hook skips with a warning, and CI still scans.
- **pre-push** blocks pushing directly to `develop`, `test` or `main`, and branch names other than `feature/...`
  and `fix/...`.

Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.

### Branches

Every change takes the same path: `feature/...` or `fix/...` → `develop` → `test` → `main`.

| Branch              | Is for            | Deploys to        | Merges into                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `feature/<name>`    | A new feature     | Nowhere (CI only) | `develop`: squash merge, no approval needed |
| `fix/<name>`        | A bug fix         | Nowhere (CI only) | `develop`: squash merge, no approval needed |
| `develop` (default) | Development       | Dev environment   | `test`: merge commit, the owner approves    |
| `test`              | Testing a version | Test environment  | `main`: merge commit, the owner approves    |
| `main`              | Customers         | Production        | —                                           |

- Branch from the latest `develop`: `git switch develop && git pull && git switch -c feature/short-name`.
  Names: lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-` after the prefix.
- GitHub rejects new branches with any other name (Dependabot's `dependabot/...` is the exception), direct pushes
  to `develop`, `test` and `main`, force pushes and deleting them.
- Keep branches short-lived (days, not weeks) and focused on one thing.

### Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add Google sign-in button
fix: stop crash when profile picture is missing
docs: explain how to run the backend locally
chore(deps): bump http to 1.6.0
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
The squash-merged PR title sets the next version: `feat` → minor, everything else → patch, `!` after the type
(`feat!:`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` line → major.
Write the subject in the imperative ("add", not "added"), lower case, no trailing period.

### Pull requests

1. Run this repo's checks locally (see **This repository** below). They must pass.
2. Push your branch and open a PR into `develop`. Fill in the template.
3. The required checks must be green ✅: **CI**, **Secret scan**, **Dependency scan** and **Branch guard**
   (the PR is on an allowed path).
4. **Squash merge** into `develop`. The PR title becomes the commit message, so it must follow Conventional Commits.
5. To move changes up: a PR **`develop` → `test`**, then **`test` → `main`**. Each needs the owner's approval
   (`goawaygoofficial`, the code owner) and is merged with a **merge commit**, never squash, so the branches keep
   the same history.

Rules:

- **Never merge a PR with a failing (❌) or pending check.**
- Every bug fix or feature includes tests, or the PR explains why not.
- No secrets in code. Config goes in `.env` / environment variables, with placeholders in `.env.example`.
- UI changes include before/after screenshots.

These rules are enforced by GitHub repository rulesets (the repos are public, so they are free) and the
**Branch guard** workflow.

### Bug fixes

A bug fix is a `fix/<name>` branch and follows the same path as everything else: `develop` → `test` → `main`.
There are no hotfix branches.

### Dependencies

Dependabot opens update PRs into `develop` every Monday. Minor and patch updates are grouped into one PR.
Review them like any other PR: CI must pass, and read the changelog for major updates.

### Security

- Never commit `.env`, keys, keystores, service-account files or passwords. `.gitignore` covers the usual ones.
- If a secret is committed, even on a branch, **rotate it immediately**. Deleting the commit is not enough.
  The repos are public: anything pushed can be read and copied at once.
- Report security issues privately to the repo owner, not in a public issue.

### This repository: Web (React + TypeScript + Vite)

```bash
nvm use                       # Node version from .nvmrc
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # fill in VITE_API_BASE_URL and VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
npm run dev
```

Check to run before every PR (the same one CI runs):

```bash
npm run check                 # typecheck + lint + format check + build
```

Format code with `npm run format`.

## Conventions and decisions

GoAwayGo is three product repos (plus the automation and performance test repos), cloned side by side in one folder (`Dev/Goaway` on the owner's PC):

| Folder          | Stack                                                                                                                        | GitHub repo (public)                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `app_frontend/` | Flutter 3.47 (Dart ^3.13), provider, http, google_sign_in, flutter_secure_storage, Sentry, PostHog                           | `goawaygoofficial/goawaygo_app_frontend` |
| `web_frontend/` | React 19, TypeScript (strict), Vite 8, react-router-dom 7, CSS Modules — web version of the app, mirrors it screen by screen | `goawaygoofficial/goawaygo_web_frontend` |
| `backend/`      | Spring Boot 4.1, Java 17, Maven (`mvnw`), PostgreSQL 17 (Docker Compose locally, Testcontainers in tests), Flyway, Sentry    | `goawaygoofficial/goawaygo_backend`      |

The parent folder is not a git repo: run git and gh inside each repo folder.

### GitHub

- Account: `goawaygoofficial` (not the global git identity on this PC — don't use that here).
- Each repo has local git config `user.name=goawaygoofficial` and GitHub's private no-reply `user.email` (the repos are public, decided 2026-11-11: the team email stays out of commits).
- `gh` CLI is logged in as `goawaygoofficial` with ADMIN on all repos.
- Default branch: `develop`.

### Branching (all repos)

Path for every change (MVP 2, decided 2026-11-11): `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>` → `develop` → `test` → `main`.

| Branch               | Environment | Rules                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature/*`, `fix/*` | CI only     | Branch from latest `develop`; PR into `develop`; no other branch names (GitHub rejects them) |
| `develop` (default)  | Dev         | Squash-merge PRs from `feature/*`/`fix/*`/`dependabot/*`; no approval needed                 |
| `test`               | Test        | Only a PR from `develop`, approved by `goawaygoofficial`, merged with a **merge commit**     |
| `main`               | Production  | Only a PR from `test`, approved by `goawaygoofficial`, merged with a **merge commit**        |

- PRs are opened and merged by the bot account `goawaygo-bot` (`gh` is signed in as it; these repos push through
  `gh`). The user approves PRs into `test` and `main` as `goawaygoofficial` (CODEOWNERS); a PR author can't approve
  their own PR.
- No Claude attribution: no `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, no "Generated with Claude Code" line, and always an
  explicit `commit_message` when squash-merging (otherwise GitHub copies old trailers into the commit).
- Merge via the API, `develop`:
  `gh api -X PUT repos/goawaygoofficial/<repo>/pulls/<n>/merge -f merge_method=squash -f sha=<head> -f commit_title="<PR title> (#<n>)" -f commit_message="<summary>"`;
  `test` and `main`: the same with `merge_method=merge`.
- A merge into `test` or `main` starts **Controller** (`.github/workflows/controller.yaml`, 5.4): it deploys the
  version whose files match the branch to test or prod, only if that version passed the environment below (its
  GitHub Release "Deployments" section shows ✅), after the owner approves the deploy. Rollback: run Controller by
  hand on `test` or `main` with a version (**Releasing** (README)).
- Tests as evidence (5.5, 5.6): `tests.yml` in each product repo runs the automation tests (repo
  `goawaygo_automation_tests`: Playwright API + website, Maestro app) and performance tests (`goawaygo_performance_tests`:
  k6 API + website, app start-up and scrolling) from the branch matching the environment, after every deploy (Release,
  Controller) and as smoke tests on pull requests (`tests-before.yml`). Results go into the release ("AT dev ✅",
  "PT dev ✅"); Controller needs both from the environment below. dev and test answer test runs (header
  `X-GoAwayGo-Test`, secret `TEST_FAKES_TOKEN`) with fake outside services and no rate limits; prod never.
- Enforced by GitHub repository rulesets (free on public repos): branch names, no direct or force pushes, no
  deleting `develop`/`test`/`main`, required checks, the owner's approval into `test` and `main`. The
  **Branch guard** check fails a PR on any other path; the `pre-push` hook gives the same answers locally.

### Workflow rules

- Per task: branch → code + tests → run checks locally → commit → push → open PR to `develop` → stop for the user's review.
- Show the changes and get the user's OK before any PR merge, release, or deploy.
- Never merge with failing or pending checks (`gh pr checks <n>`), even if asked — fix them first.
- Never bypass git hooks (`--no-verify`). Hooks live in `.githooks/`; enable per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- **Conventions and decisions** (README) exists in this folder and as a copy in each repo — keep all copies in sync.

### CI (GitHub Actions, every repo)

- `CI` — app: dart format check, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, debug APK build · web: `npm run check` · backend: `./mvnw verify`
- `Secret scan` — Gitleaks over full history
- `Branch guard` — on every PR: only allowed merge paths (required check)
- Dependabot: weekly grouped update PRs into `develop` (deps + GitHub Actions)
- Free plan = 2,000 Actions minutes/month; avoid needless re-runs.

### Secrets — never commit

- App frontend: `.env` (bundled as a Flutter asset — public config only: `BASE_URL`, `WEBSITE_URL`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `POSTHOG_KEY`; keep `.env.example` in sync), `android/app/google-services.json` (if Firebase is ever added), `android/local.properties`, keystores, `key.properties`.
- Web frontend: `.env` / `.env.*` (`VITE_*` values end up in the JS bundle — public config only; keep `.env.example` in sync).
- Backend: `backend/.env` (gitignored; template `.env.example`) holds local DB passwords and is read by both Docker Compose and Spring Boot (`spring.config.import`). Deployed environments use env vars. Never put secrets in `application.properties`. Never print `.env` values in chat.

### Commands

- App frontend: `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `flutter run`
- Web frontend (Node 22.12+, `.nvmrc` = 24): `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + format check + build — run before every PR)
- Backend (JDK 17+, Docker Desktop): `docker compose up -d` (PostgreSQL 17 on 127.0.0.1:5433), `./mvnw spring-boot:run`, `./mvnw verify` (tests start their own PostgreSQL via Testcontainers)
- App CI pins Flutter 3.47.7 (matches local); update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` when upgrading.

### Database (backend)

- Roles: `postgres` (container superuser, setup only) · `goawaygo_owner` (owns schema; Flyway only) · `goawaygo_app` (runtime; SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, no DDL). Created by `docker/postgres/init/01-create-roles.sh`, reused by tests; `DatabaseSetupTests` verifies it.
- Schema changes only via new Flyway migrations `src/main/resources/db/migration/V<n>__<desc>.sql`; never edit a merged migration.
- Backend runs in UTC (`BackendApplication.main` + surefire `-Duser.timezone=UTC`): Windows reports the legacy zone `Asia/Calcutta`, which PostgreSQL 17 (Debian 13 image) rejects.
- Keep the `postgres:` image tag in `compose.yaml` and `PostgresIntegrationTest` in sync.

### Authentication (decided: short JWT + rotating refresh token)

- Access token: ES256 JWT, **20 min**, `Authorization: Bearer`; not stored. Keys: `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` (base64 DER) in `backend/.env`; each environment has its own pair; never print or commit them.
- Refresh token: random, **30 days**, stored only as SHA-256 in `refresh_tokens`; rotated on every use; reuse of a rotated token revokes the whole family.
- Mobile sends `X-Client-Type: mobile` → refresh token in JSON body (store in Keychain/Keystore). Web → refresh token only in `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` cookie `goawaygo_refresh` on `/api/auth`; keep access token in memory, never `localStorage`.
- Profile: `GET /api/users/me` (own profile only). There is no `GET /api/auth/users/{id}`: the old frontend code that calls it must be replaced.
- Errors: always `{status, error, message[, fieldErrors]}`; clients branch on `error`.
- Never trust identity from the client; derive the user from the access token (`jwt.getSubject()`).
- Password reset / email verification: single-use emailed links (`user_action_tokens`, SHA-256 hashes; reset 30 min, verify 24 h) opening the website (`/reset-password`, `/verify-email`). Forgot-password must not reveal whether an account exists (same 202 body; email sent after commit in the background). Never accept `{email, newPassword}`.
- Email: SMTP only (`EmailSender`/`EmailOutbox`). Local: Mailpit from `docker compose` (inbox http://localhost:8025). Deployed: Resend over SMTP (`MAIL_*` env vars; the API key is a secret). Never log email bodies (they contain one-time links).
- Rate limits (Bucket4j, in-memory per instance): per IP on public `/api/auth/*`, per email on signin/forgot-password; 429 + `Retry-After`. Tests disable it in `PostgresIntegrationTest`.

### Google Sign-In

- App ID (Android `applicationId`/`namespace`, iOS/macOS bundle ID): **`com.goawaygo.app`**. Permanent once on Google Play.
- App minimum OS: **Android 8.0** (API 26, `minSdk = 26` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`), **iOS 15.0**, macOS 12.0, required by `sentry_flutter` 10. Don't lower them.
- Google Cloud project `goaway-483709` (number `1018541563002`), consent screen in **Testing** (only listed test users can sign in). OAuth clients (IDs are public; never handle client secrets):
  - Web `1018541563002-sft2jld5f3n6lnenvt0pk8hknk7hfq9n.apps.googleusercontent.com`: website, and the ID-token audience (`serverClientId`) for the mobile app. Origins: `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost`.
  - Android `1018541563002-s8eo8sn5e7dt9kaav6rm0mhgea6tgir9.apps.googleusercontent.com`: package + the user's debug SHA-1 `79:E2:F5:3A:AD:5E:E7:84:08:30:CE:07:1C:9A:F0:EC:FB:90:2F:C8`. Release / Play App Signing SHA-1 needs its own Android client later.
  - iOS `1018541563002-ss0dur7e8d4l9c2lb2o89edgouqrd2fv.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Backend must verify Google ID tokens (signature via Google JWKs, `iss`, `exp`, `aud` ∈ configured client IDs, `email_verified`) and never trust user details sent alongside them.
- Mobile sends the ID token to `/api/auth/google-signin`. The website uses its own styled button + Google code client (popup) and sends the one-time code to `/api/auth/google-signin/code`; the backend exchanges it with `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (backend `.env` only, entered by the user; never ask for it in chat, never print it).

### Discover, Wanderbook, Book, the trip planner, notifications and Me (4.1-4.6)

- **How we build:** MVP rounds. MVP 1 builds every Phase 4 sub-phase; fixes, changes and new ideas go into later MVPs (see **Roadmap** (README)).
- Outside services go through the backend's API toolkit (`com.goawaygo.backend.external`) with daily limits below free tiers: Gemini (destination cards, trip ideas), Geoapify (places, photo location → place name), Wikimedia and Unsplash (photos), OpenAI moderation (Wanderbook), Travelpayouts (Book: Aviasales prices, affiliate links). Keys: Secret Manager `goawaygo-api-<name>` + repo variable `EXTERNAL_API_PROVIDERS`. Never store Discover's AI answers or spot photos (asked fresh on every page open); a trip plan is the user's own content once saved (`trip_plans`).
- Wanderbook photos: originals (never resized), only location data removed by the backend; exact coordinates never stored. Stored in R2 `goawaygo-media` (`media.goawaygo.com`), key via `scripts/gcp-secrets.sh <project> r2` + repo variable `WANDERBOOK_PHOTOS=true`. Uploads stop at 9.5 GB.
- Moderation fails closed: if OpenAI can't check, nothing is posted. Reports email `team@goawaygo.com`; admins (`users.is_admin`, set by hand in Neon) review on the website's `/admin/reports`.
- Viewing Wanderbook is public (rate limited per IP); profiles/posts use random 12-character public ids, never user ids.
- Trip planner: Gemini (Lite models first) writes a day-by-day plan with rough costs (whole group, flights never included); signed-in users only, saved in My Trips, one day can be rewritten, a plan can be shared read-only by link after an OpenAI moderation check.
- Notifications: saved for the bell (90 days) on the app and website; pushed to Android through Firebase Cloud Messaging with the backend's own service account (no key); a switch per type; trip reminders run from a daily GitHub Actions call. The app's Firebase IDs are public values in `env/staging.env` (never commit `google-services.json`).
- Languages (4.7): en, hi, es, fr, de, ar (RTL), ja. Backend text the user sees goes through `T.t(lang, "English sentence {0}", args)` with translations in `src/main/resources/i18n/<code>.json` (the English sentence is the key; `LanguageTests` checks every file has the same keys and placeholders). New user-facing backend text needs all six translations. Requests carry `Accept-Language`; `users.language` is for pushes and emails. Legal pages stay English.
- Me: the account name and photo are also the Wanderbook name and photo. Changing the password or email and deleting the account first confirm it's you (password, or Google without one). Deleting hides the account for 30 days (signing in keeps it), then the daily GitHub Actions job deletes its R2 files and the account (every table cascades); queries that show people to others must skip `users.deletion_requested_at IS NOT NULL`. Phone sign-in waits for MVP 2 (SMS costs money).
- Book: affiliate model, travellers book and pay on the partner's site. Flights show Aviasales' recent prices (labelled "may change"); stays and cars are partner links. Every partner page becomes our tracked link via Travelpayouts (`goawaygo.book.*`); the app only shows brands that allow apps. Never load partner scripts (e.g. Travelpayouts Drive) on our site.

### Deployment

Domain `goawaygo.com` (Cloudflare Registrar + DNS). Website and API must stay on the same registrable domain (the refresh cookie is `SameSite=Strict`).

- Pre-launch (alpha/beta, all free): backend on Google Cloud Run `asia-southeast1` (prod: project `goawaygo-prod`, service `goawaygo-backend`, `api.goawaygo.com`; dev and test: project `goawaygo-staging`); database Neon PostgreSQL 17 (AWS Singapore); website on Cloudflare Pages (prod `goawaygo.com` since 2026-11-13 with `www` redirecting to it, dev `dev.goawaygo.com`, test `test.goawaygo.com`; no other addresses); email Resend; Android testers via Firebase App Distribution.
- Naming (MVP 2): **staging** = non-production (dev, test), **prod** = production. Neon projects `goawaygo-staging` (`goawaygo_dev`, `goawaygo_test`) and `goawaygo-prod` (`goawaygo`); Google Cloud projects `goawaygo-staging` (dev, test, the shared image registry) and `goawaygo-prod` (production, since 2026-11-12). A shared key (Google, Resend, R2, outside APIs) is changed in both projects.
- At launch (Phase 5): database moves to Google Cloud SQL; Play Console then. Company not registered yet.
- Backend: every version deploys to dev automatically after CI passes on `develop` (`.github/workflows/release.yml` → `deploy.yml`, keyless Workload Identity Federation); test and prod get the same image through `controller.yaml` (5.4). Environments: the backend README (**Deployment**). Secrets live only in Google Secret Manager; setup scripts and steps in the backend README (**Deployment**).
- Cloud Run: min 0 instances (cold start ~7–10 s after idle), max 1 (in-memory rate limits), request-based billing (CPU only during requests; emails sent inside the request). Health: `GET /actuator/health` (no DB check, so Neon can sleep).
- Google free trial ends 90 days after sign-up: upgrade billing before then or the project stops.
- After a merge: backend and website deploy themselves; Android builds are released by hand with `app_frontend/scripts/release-android.sh` (upload key on the release PC only). Step by step: **Releasing** (README) (copy in every repo). What's next: **Roadmap** (README) (copy in every repo; tick items as they ship).
- Shared docs, identical in the workspace root and every repo (edit the root copy, then copy it into the three repos with their `<!-- Copy of ... -->` header): **Conventions and decisions** (README), **Releasing** (README), **Roadmap** (README), **Resources and outside services** (README) (what each service is for) `LINKS.md` (dashboards, routine, onboarding) and **History** (README) (the goawaygo.com launch checklist, 5.7).

## Resources and outside services

Every service, library and tool GoAwayGo uses, what it does for us, and which part uses it: **B** = backend,
**W** = website, **A** = Android app. All on free tiers until launch. Links: `LINKS.md`.

| **Google Secret Manager**                            | Holds every secret (DB passwords, JWT keys, Google client secret, Resend key, future API keys); the backend reads them at start. GitHub never sees them. | B           | `backend/scripts/gcp-secrets.sh`                            |

## Roadmap

Where the project stands and what comes next. Tick items as they ship (merged to `develop` and live on dev).
Shared by all three repos; how to ship is in **Releasing** (README).

### Done

- [x] **Phase 1 — Foundation:** repos, branching (`develop`/`main`), CI, secret scanning, Dependabot.
- [x] **Phase 2 — Backend and login:** PostgreSQL, JWT + rotating refresh tokens, Google Sign-In, rate limits,
      email verification and password reset, website and app connected, UI matched across web and app.
- [x] **Phase 3 — Staging:** `api.goawaygo.com` (Cloud Run + Neon), `staging.goawaygo.com` (Cloudflare Pages),
      Resend email, Android builds via `staging.goawaygo.com/download` and Firebase beta (1.0.0 build 4).

### Phase 4 — Features

Direction (confirmed 2026-10-25): **free resources only** until launch · **global market** (English first, every
currency) · bookings through **affiliate partners** (commission; users book on the partner's site) · Wanderbook like
Instagram · phone sign-in with SMS (MVP 2). Each sub-phase's own choices (providers, limits) are decided when it
starts and recorded in its section below.

**How we build (decided 2026-10-31):** in MVP rounds. **MVP 1** builds every sub-phase below (4.1 to 4.7) without
stopping for fix rounds; fixes, changes and new ideas are collected for **MVP 2, 3, 4, ...** after that.

#### 4.0 Foundations

Accounts (team Gmail, free): Sentry, PostHog, Better Stack. Existing: Cloudflare (Web Analytics, Email Routing),
Google Cloud.

- [x] **4.0a Error tracking** — Sentry in backend (Spring Boot), website (React) and app (Flutter): one
      organisation, a project per part, `staging` environment, release = version/commit, no personal data sent
      (`sendDefaultPii` off, emails/tokens scrubbed). Backend: JSON logs that Google Cloud Logging understands,
      request IDs in every log line and error.
- [x] **4.0b Health and uptime** — `GET /actuator/health` (status only, nothing else exposed); Better Stack checks
      the API and the website every 3 min and emails on downtime; public status page `status.goawaygo.com`.
- [x] **4.0c Legal and privacy** — Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Delete-my-data page on the website (DPDP Act
      2023 / Rules 2025 based: notice, consent, purposes, rights, retention, grievance contact); links in the website
      footer, the sign-up screens and the app's Profile. Contact addresses `privacy@` and `support@goawaygo.com` via
      Cloudflare Email Routing (forward to the team Gmail). Written for international law (GDPR, US state laws, DPDP,
      LGPD). **Still to do before launch: lawyer review.**
- [x] **4.0d Analytics with consent** — Cloudflare Web Analytics on the website (cookieless, aggregate, no consent
      needed); PostHog (product analytics + feature flags) in website and app, **only after the user agrees**, with a
      short event list and no personal data in events; consent choice changeable in Profile.
- [x] **4.0e API toolkit (backend)** — one way to call outside APIs: timeouts, retries and circuit breaker
      (Resilience4j), a database cache table with expiry, per-provider usage counters that stop before a free limit
      is exceeded, keys from Secret Manager. Plus a vulnerability scan of dependencies in CI (OSV-Scanner) for all
      repos.

#### 4.1 Discover

Decided 2026-10-26. Design and reasons: `backend/**Discover: destination pages, photos and ideas** (backend README).

- **Search:** type a place (country, region, city, landmark), pick or search, open its destination page. Place
  search: **Geoapify** (free, worldwide OpenStreetMap data). Unknown places: "We couldn't find that place".
- **Destination page:** shown all at once when ready (a travel animation until then). A sliding banner of up to 8
  tourist spots: the AI's top attractions with their **Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons** photos (same name and nearby,
  so a wrong place can't appear), plus spots **Wikidata** lists nearby with **Unsplash** photos (only if the photo's
  description names the spot). Credit on every photo; fetched live, never stored.
- **9 info cards** (Quick Facts, Visa & Entry Rules, Best Time to Visit, Top Attractions, Best Areas to Stay, Food &
  Dining, Getting Around, Travel Insurance, Money & Connectivity): **one AI request per page open** returning the 9
  cards as separate JSON fields; nothing stored. Models in order: **Gemini 3 Flash** (free: 5/min, 20/day) →
  **Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite** (15/min) → **Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite** (15/min, 500/day), from a no-billing Google
  project; paid Gemini at launch. Temperature 0.1, fixed seed, response schema; each card checked on its own;
  changing details tagged "may vary"; links checked before showing; tap a card to expand.
- **Home banner:** the user's own last searches, up to 5 (account when signed in, the device otherwise), each with a
  live tourist-spot photo, sliding; tap to open. None yet: "No recent searches".
- **Ideas for your next trip:** every hour the AI suggests 30 varied places worldwide (beaches, mountains, heritage,
  cities, hidden gems and popular places), each confirmed on Wikipedia, kept in memory only; a random 6 every
  minute with category and "hidden gem" tags, **Save to My Trips**; tap to open.
- **My Trips:** saved places (sign-in needed).
- [x] Accounts: billing-free Google project + Gemini key, Geoapify key, Unsplash app (keys in Secret Manager)
- [x] Backend: place search, recent searches, AI cards, tourist spots and photos, random ideas, saved places
- [x] Website · [x] App · [x] Privacy Policy (stored search history, place names sent to Google for AI)

#### 4.2 Wanderbook

Decided 2026-10-28.

- **Viewing:** anyone can view public profiles and posts, signed in or not (rate limited per IP against scraping);
  posting, liking, commenting and following need an account.
- **Profiles:** account name and photo, cover photo, bio, home town, counts, post grid; a random public id in links.
  **Public or private:** following a private profile sends a request the owner approves or declines; only approved
  followers see its posts and lists; making it public approves waiting requests.
- **Posts:** 1-10 photos, caption, place tag filled in from the photo's location (place, state, country; editable,
  or added by hand; opens the destination page); edit caption, delete. Likes and comments (delete your own, and
  comments on your posts).
- **Feed:** one shared timeline of the newest posts from all public profiles, private profiles you follow, and yours.
- **People search** by name.
- **Safety:** every photo and text checked by **OpenAI omni-moderation** (free) before it appears; report posts,
  comments and users; block (hides both ways, removes follows); reports emailed to the team plus an admin page on
  the website.
- **Photos:** originals, never resized or recompressed (a scrapbook of memories), shown as they are everywhere.
  Exact coordinates are never published or stored: the backend turns the photo's GPS into the place tag and removes
  the GPS from the file without touching the picture. iPhone HEIC photos become full-size JPEGs on the phone
  (browsers can't show HEIC). Uploaded one by one through the backend (checked first) into Cloudflare R2
  (`goawaygo-media`, `media.goawaygo.com`); uploads stop before the free 10 GB (about 2,000 photos) is used up.
- **Legal:** Terms (rules for user content), Community Guidelines page, Privacy Policy and Delete my data updated.
- [x] Accounts: OpenAI key, R2 bucket `goawaygo-media` and access key (Secret Manager)
- [x] Backend: profiles, follows and requests, private profiles, blocks, people search
- [x] Backend: photos and moderation, posts, likes, comments, feed, reports, admin
- [x] Website · [x] App · [x] Legal pages (Terms, Community Guidelines, Privacy Policy, Delete my data)

#### 4.3 Book

Decided 2026-11-01 ("option E"): build now with what is open to a pre-launch app; each category moves to live
prices when a partner approves us, without new screens. Full comparison: the founders' findings doc.

- **Flights:** Aviasales' recent prices (Travelpayouts Data API, free): the cheapest fare on the date asked, cheaper
  dates that month, a price calendar, and "See all flights" (Aviasales' live search). Labelled "recent, may change".
- **Stays and cars:** partner cards opened on the traveller's search (no free price source exists). App: brands that
  allow apps only (Trip.com; DiscoverCars, EconomyBookings, QEEQ); website: those plus website-only brands later.
- **Links:** every partner page becomes our affiliate link (Travelpayouts links API, marker 798632, project
  597168); a partner that hasn't approved us yet gets its plain page. Commission disclosure on every results page.
- **Live prices later:** KAYAK (flights, hotels, cars; sandbox received, production pending) and Agoda (hotels;
  rejected 2026-11-07, reapply once `goawaygo.com` is the real site with crawlable travel content).
- [x] Accounts: Travelpayouts (Aviasales, EconomyBookings connected; Trip.com, DiscoverCars in review), KAYAK sandbox
- [x] Backend: airports, recent flight prices and calendar, partner links, stays and cars partners
- [x] Website · [x] App · [x] Legal pages (affiliate disclosure in Terms and Privacy Policy) · [x] Released in 1.2.0 build 8

#### 4.4 AI trip planner

Decided 2026-11-08.

- **Plan:** from a destination page or a saved place in My Trips: start date, 1-10 days, travellers (solo, couple,
  family, friends), pace, budget level and interests. Each day has a morning, afternoon and evening (place, what to
  do, rough cost), food picks and a tip; plus a title, summary and trip tips.
- **Budget estimate:** about X a day for food, transport and activities and Y a night for stays, for the whole group;
  labelled an AI estimate, flights never included.
- **Change a day:** rewrite one day, optionally with a wish ("more street food"); the other days stay.
- **Share by link:** read-only page anyone can open, after an OpenAI moderation check (also for changes to a
  shared plan).
- **Booking shortcuts:** Stays and Car rentals open for the plan's place and dates; Flights opens with the destination.
- **AI:** Gemini (3.1 Flash Lite → 3.5 Flash Lite → 3 Flash), like Discover; a better model later. Signed-in users
  only: 5 new plans and 20 day changes a day per account, 50 saved plans.
- [x] Backend: plans, change a day, share, budget estimate
- [x] Website · [x] App · [x] Legal pages (trip plans in Privacy Policy and Terms) · [x] Released in 1.3.0 build 9

#### 4.5 Notifications

Decided 2026-11-09.

- **Events:** Wanderbook (new follower, follow request, request accepted, likes on your post grouped per post,
  comments on your post); trip reminders (a saved plan starts in 3 days, and tomorrow); someone opened your shared
  plan (at most once a day per plan); GoAwayGo announcements (sent by an admin from the website).
- **Where:** the bell on Home lists them on the app and the website (unread count, mark as read, open the post,
  profile or plan). Push only on the Android app, through Firebase Cloud Messaging (free); no browser push.
- **Permission (Android 13+):** asked once after sign-in; if dismissed, once more at a useful moment (after following
  someone, posting or saving a plan); always a switch in Profile.
- **Settings:** a switch per type (Wanderbook, trip reminders, shared plans, announcements) turns off its push; the
  bell still lists everything. Notifications are kept 90 days.
- **How it runs:** the backend sends pushes with its own Google service account (no key file; it needs the Firebase
  Cloud Messaging role in project `goaway-483709`, then the repo variable `FCM_PROJECT`). Trip reminders: a daily
  GitHub Actions job at 09:00 IST calls the backend's reminder run. The app reads its Firebase settings from
  `env/staging.env` (public IDs; no `google-services.json`).
- [x] Backend: notifications, device tokens, settings, push, reminders, announcements
- [x] Website · [x] App · [x] Legal pages (device tokens and notifications in the Privacy Policy) · [x] Released in 1.4.0 build 10

#### 4.6 Me

Decided 2026-11-09.

- **Edit your account** (User Profile): name and photo (the same as on Wanderbook), password (change it with the
  current one, or set one on a Google account), email (the new address must be confirmed by a link first; the old
  one is told), country and currency (used later to show prices in your currency, 4.7). Changing the password, the
  email or deleting the account first asks to confirm it's you: your password, or Google for accounts without one.
- **Delete account** (app and website, as Google Play requires, plus the Delete my data page): 30 days to change your
  mind. At once: signed out everywhere, pushes stopped, profile, posts and comments hidden from others, and an email
  with the date. Signing in again within 30 days keeps the account. After 30 days the daily job deletes its photo
  files, then the account and everything in it, and sends a last email.
- **Recently viewed:** places and trip plans opened (your own and shared ones), newest first, the latest 30; saved
  for signed-in accounts, on the device otherwise; can be cleared. My Trips was already done in 4.1 and 4.4.
- **Phone sign-up and sign-in with SMS: moved to MVP 2.** SMS can't be kept at $0: Firebase sends real SMS only with
  billing on, its free allowance may cover only test numbers, India costs about $0.07 a text, and Google Cloud
  budgets only alert, they can't stop charges.
- [x] Backend: account details, password, email change, delete with 30 days, daily deletion job, Recently viewed
- [x] Website · [x] App · [x] Legal pages (Delete my data, Privacy Policy)

#### 4.7 Global readiness

Decided 2026-11-10.

- **Languages:** English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Arabic (right to left) and Japanese, on the app and the
  website. The user picks one (or the phone or browser's language is used); the apps send it as
  `Accept-Language`, and the account keeps it for pushes and emails. Translations written with AI help: **a native
  speaker checks each language before launch.** Legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms, Delete my data, Community
  Guidelines) stay in English, the version that counts.
- **AI content** (destination cards, trip plans, ideas) is written in the user's language. Place names stay in their
  usual international form, so photos and Wikipedia checks keep working. A trip plan keeps the language it was made
  in.
- **Currencies:** prices in the user's currency everywhere (flight fares from Aviasales, trip plan costs, the
  exchange rate on destination pages). Signed in: the currency in User Profile; signed out: guessed from the phone or
  browser's region, changeable.
- **Regions and formats:** dates, numbers and prices shown the local way for the user's language and region.
- **Reviews before launch:** accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), speed (website bundle, images, app startup), security
  (OWASP Top 10 across the three repos, website security headers). Each ends with fixes and a short report.
- [x] Backend: languages and currencies · [x] Website · [x] App
- [x] Accessibility · [x] Speed · [x] Security · [x] Regions and formats

#### Later sub-phases

A detailed checklist (and that sub-phase's decisions) is added when it starts. Notes so far:

- **Phone sign-in (MVP 2, carried over):** SMS is never free (Firebase: billing required, billed per SMS by country): cap it then.
- Wanderbook photos: R2 bucket `goawaygo-user-media`. Push: Firebase Cloud Messaging (free).

### MVP 2 — Release pipeline and website launch

Decided 2026-11-10 and 2026-11-11. The website launches for customers on `goawaygo.com` from `main`. The Android
app stays an APK download with beta testing; a store launch comes in a later MVP. The beta app uses production.
Every change ships through versions that move up through three environments, with automated and performance tests
as evidence.

| Branch        | Purpose                                   | Deploys to                                    | Merges to                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `feature/...` | A new feature                             | nowhere (tested inside CI)                    | → `develop` only, no approval   |
| `fix/...`     | A bug fix                                 | nowhere (tested inside CI)                    | → `develop` only, no approval   |
| `develop`     | Development: every change, a new version  | **dev** (`api-dev`, `dev.goawaygo.com`)       | → `test` only, owner's approval |
| `test`        | Testing a version before customers see it | **test** (`api-test`, `test.goawaygo.com`)    | → `main` only, owner's approval |
| `main`        | Customers                                 | **prod** (`api.goawaygo.com`, `goawaygo.com`) | —                               |

Any other branch name is rejected (Dependabot's `dependabot/...` is allowed). Pull requests are opened by the bot
account `goawaygo-bot` and approved by `goawaygoofficial`; deployments to test and prod need the same approval. The
repos are public (2026-11-11): free branch rules, protected environments and Actions minutes.

- [x] **5.1 Branches and rules** — `test` branch; branch name rules; only `feature`/`fix` → `develop` → `test` →
      `main`; approvals on `test` and `main`; branch guard as a required check.
- [x] **5.2 Versions** — every merge into `develop` makes a version (`feat:` raises the minor number, `fix:` the
      patch) with a GitHub Release and artifacts built once: the backend image and the website build. The website reads
      its settings when it starts, so one build runs in every environment.
- [x] **5.3 Three environments** — dev, test, prod on free tiers: Cloud Run ×3, Neon projects `goawaygo-staging` (dev, test) and `goawaygo-prod`, production in its own Google Cloud project `goawaygo-prod`, Cloudflare Pages
      domains, secrets per environment, Google sign-in origins, Sentry and PostHog environments. Done 2026-11-11/12: dev
      (`api-dev`, `dev.goawaygo.com`), test (`api-test`, `test.goawaygo.com`), production moved to the Google Cloud
      project `goawaygo-prod` (`api.goawaygo.com`, 2026-11-12).
- [x] **5.4 `controller.yaml`** — deploys a version to test or prod, only if it is merged there and passed AT and PT
      in the environment below; deployment status per version; rollback to an earlier version. Done 2026-11-12:
      first promotions to test and prod (backend v1.9.0, website and app v1.8.0); the AT and PT condition comes with
      5.5 and 5.6.
- [x] **5.5 Automation tests** (repo `goawaygo_automation_tests`) — API and website (Playwright), app (Maestro on an
      Android emulator); a short run on every pull request, the full run after each deployment. Done 2026-11-12/13:
      22 API, 9 website and 3 app tests pass in dev and test; read-only smoke tests in prod. They found a real bug
      (a tap between a tab's icon and label was ignored; fixed).
- [x] **5.6 Performance tests** (repo `goawaygo_performance_tests`) — API and website (k6), app start-up and
      scrolling; limits that fail the run; fake AI and partner services in dev and test. Done 2026-11-12/13: limits
      on the backend's own time (Server-Timing on test runs: reads ~3 ms, destination ~31 ms p95), Core Web Vitals,
      app start-up ~1 s and scrolling on the emulator. A version moves up only with AT and PT ✅ below.
- [ ] **5.7 Website launch** — pre-rendered public pages (search engines and partners can read them), sitemap,
      production monitoring and alerts, database backups, Google sign-in in production mode, launch checklist; then
      apply to Agoda again.
- [ ] **5.8 Product changes** — from the MVP 1 testing, added here as they are sorted.

Carried over: phone sign-in with SMS (only if it can be capped), Booking.com through Travelpayouts (late December),
KAYAK, smaller copies of Wanderbook photos, a native speaker's check of the translations.

### Phase 5 — Launch

App store launch (a later MVP) · company registration · Play Console + Android developer verification (before the
2027 rule reaches India) · production database on Cloud SQL (the website launched on Neon in MVP 2, 2026-11-13) · Google billing upgraded before the
trial ends (2027-01-14) · DPDP compliance review (substantive obligations from 13 May 2027).

## History

### Website launch (MVP 2, 5.7)

The website goes live for customers on `goawaygo.com`, served from `main` (the `prod` environment). Decided
2026-11-13: launch now; the lawyer review of the legal pages and the native-speaker check of the 6 other languages
come right after launch. Work through the parts in order and tick each box. Commands run in Git Bash; console steps
name the exact menus.

#### A. Before the switch

**Website build** (done in code, 5.7)

- [x] Public pages pre-rendered with their own titles and descriptions; `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`; dev, test,
      staging and `pages.dev` copies send `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` (website PR #70).
- [x] 50 destination pages rendered from prod's data during each prod website deploy (#71).
- [x] A website version with both is in prod (v1.11.2, 13 Nov 2026: 50 of 50 destination pages, 59 sitemap entries).

**Database backups** (backend **Deployment** (README), "Database backups")

- [x] Key pair made (`scripts/backup-keys.sh`) and an offline copy of the private key kept.
- [x] R2 bucket `goawaygo-backups` with a 30-day lifecycle rule; its token stored as `R2_BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
      `R2_BACKUP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; the deployer may read `goawaygo-db-owner-password`.
- [x] First backup run green (Actions → Database backup → Run workflow); the copy is in R2.
- [x] Practice restore into a scratch database (`scripts/restore-backup.sh`) worked.

**Monitoring and alerts**

- [x] Better Stack → Monitors: **GoAwayGo website (goawaygo.com)** checks `https://goawaygo.com/home` for the keyword
      "GoAwayGo" every 3 minutes (follows redirects, so it works before and after the switch) → email the primary
      responder. It shows as "Goaway website" on `status.goawaygo.com`, with the API and App Downloads monitors; the
      old staging website monitor is off the status page (pause it after the switch, part C).
- [x] Sentry → Monitors → Alerts (all email the suggested assignees, else recently active members):
      "Prod new error (backend + web)" and "App new error" (a new issue, an escalating issue or a regression;
      backend and web in environment `production`, the app in all environments), and "Prod error burst (backend +
      web)" and "App error burst" (an issue seen more than 50 times in an hour, at most one email an hour).
- [x] Google Cloud (project goawaygo-prod) → Monitoring: policy "GoAwayGo prod API errors (5xx)" (Cloud Run
      `goawaygo-backend` 5xx responses over 10 in 5 minutes) → email channel "GoAwayGo owner". Free within the
      Cloud Monitoring allowance.
- [x] Budget alert on the billing account still set ("goaway-auth-budget", ₹100 a month, whole billing account,
      alerts at 50, 90, 100 and 150%).

**Google sign-in in production mode** (Google Cloud project `goaway-483709`)

- [x] Google Auth Platform → **Audience** → Publishing status: **Publish app** (from "Testing" to "In production").
      With only the basic scopes (email, profile, openid) no Google review is needed; the consent screen shows the
      app name and `goawaygo.com`.
- [x] Google Auth Platform → **Branding**: home page `https://goawaygo.com`, privacy policy
      `https://goawaygo.com/privacy`, terms `https://goawaygo.com/terms`, authorised domain `goawaygo.com`.
- [x] Clients → **GoAwayGo Web** → Authorised JavaScript origins: add `https://goawaygo.com` and
      `https://www.goawaygo.com` (keep staging, dev and test for now).

#### B. The switch (about 30 minutes; pick a quiet time)

1. [x] **Backend allows the new address.** Repository variables of goawaygo_backend (Settings → Secrets and variables
       → Actions → Variables): `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` = `https://goawaygo.com,https://www.goawaygo.com,https://staging.goawaygo.com`
       and `WEB_BASE_URL` = `https://goawaygo.com` (links in emails). Then redeploy prod with the same version:
       Actions → Controller → Run workflow → branch `main` → (version empty) → approve **prod**.
2. [x] **Cloudflare → Rules**: turn off the Redirect Rule "goawaygo.com to website".
3. [x] **Cloudflare → DNS → Records**: delete the two placeholder A records `@` and `www` (`192.0.2.1`). (Done by
       step 4: adding the custom domains replaced them with CNAMEs to `goawaygo-web-prod.pages.dev`.)
4. [x] **Cloudflare → Workers & Pages → goawaygo-web-prod → Custom domains**: add `goawaygo.com`, then
       `www.goawaygo.com`. Cloudflare creates the DNS records and the certificate (a few minutes).
5. [x] **www to the main address**: Rules → Redirect Rules → Create: when hostname equals `www.goawaygo.com`, redirect
       301 to `https://goawaygo.com${path}` with the query string kept.
6. [x] **GitHub variables**: website environment `prod`: `WEB_URL` = `https://goawaygo.com`; website repository
       variable `PROD_WEB_URL` = `https://goawaygo.com` (the prod smoke tests).
7. [x] **Check**: `https://goawaygo.com/home` loads, sign-in with email and with Google works, a destination page
       loads, `https://goawaygo.com/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` answer, `https://www.goawaygo.com` redirects.
8. [x] **staging.goawaygo.com**: Redirect Rule "staging.goawaygo.com to goawaygo.com": hostname
       `staging.goawaygo.com` → 301 to `https://goawaygo.com${path}` with the query string kept. The custom domain
       stays on `goawaygo-web-frontend` for now (removing it can remove its DNS record, and the redirect needs one);
       it goes when that project is retired (part C). The beta app's legal links (`WEBSITE_URL`) keep working
       through the redirect; the next app build points at goawaygo.com directly.

Switched on 13 Nov 2026 (after a Cloudflare Workers API outage delayed steps 2–8). Checked: `/`, `/home`,
`/privacy`, `/terms` and a destination page answer 200 with their own titles, no `X-Robots-Tag`; `sitemap.xml`
(59 entries) and `robots.txt` answer; http, `www` and `staging` redirect 301 with the path and query kept; the API
accepts `https://goawaygo.com`; the Google button loads. Still to try by hand: signing in with email and with Google.

#### C. After the switch

- [x] Google Search Console: property `goawaygo.com` (domain) → Sitemaps → `https://goawaygo.com/sitemap.xml`
      submitted 13 Nov 2026: Success, 59 pages found.
- [ ] Apply to Agoda again (the partner application), now that the site is readable without JavaScript.
- [ ] Lawyer review of the Privacy Policy, Terms and Community Guidelines (decided: right after launch).
- [ ] Native-speaker check of the 6 other languages (decided: right after launch).
- [x] `staging.goawaygo.com` removed from the backend's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and the Google origins (it only
      redirects); the old Pages project `goawaygo-web-frontend` deleted (14 Nov; **History** (README)).
- [x] The disabled Redirect Rule "goawaygo.com to website" deleted.
- [x] Better Stack: the old staging website monitor deleted; status page logo links to `https://goawaygo.com`.
- [x] App: `WEBSITE_URL=https://goawaygo.com` (app PR #76), and release builds use `env/prod.env` reporting as
      `production` (**History** (README) 7.3). Both arrive with the next app build.
- [ ] **Roadmap** (README): tick 5.7 (after Agoda, the lawyer review and the native-speaker check).

### Clean-up after launch

Done 13–14 Nov 2026, after the website launched on `goawaygo.com`. Rule: everything **dev**, **test** and **prod**
use stays; everything else from before (the pre-launch "staging" setup) is deleted. The only website addresses are
`goawaygo.com` (+ `www` redirecting to it), `dev.goawaygo.com` and `test.goawaygo.com`.

#### What stays (who uses what)

"goawaygo-staging" (Google Cloud and Neon project names) is the home of dev **and** test, decided at the start of
MVP 2; project IDs can't be renamed. Shared on purpose: the image registry (goawaygo-staging), the outside-API keys
(incl. KAYAK, kept for later), Google sign-in clients (web, Android release + debug, iOS), Firebase (Android app),
Resend, R2 (`goawaygo-downloads` → downloads.goawaygo.com, `goawaygo-media` → media.goawaygo.com,
`goawaygo-backups`), email forwarding (support@, privacy@), Better Stack (status.goawaygo.com), PostHog, Search
Console, Travelpayouts, Gemini (project "GoAwayGo Gemini"), Geoapify, Unsplash, OpenAI. Developer tools stay:
localhost origins for sign-in, the AI GitHub apps.

#### What was deleted or changed

- **Google Cloud:** old v1.6.0 service `goawaygo-backend` in goawaygo-staging (it was still connected to the prod
  database) and its 6 secrets (copies of prod's database passwords, JWT keys, R2 keys); projects
  `goawaygo-prod-514417` (the duplicate) and "My First Project" shut down (gone for good after 30 days); the unused
  Firebase "Browser key" (no web app in Firebase); the Gemini project renamed "GoAwayGo Gemini".
- **Cloudflare:** Pages project `goawaygo-web-frontend` (111 old deployments first); `staging.goawaygo.com` (DNS
  record and redirect rule); the old "goawaygo.com to website" rule (the www rule is now named "www.goawaygo.com to
  goawaygo.com"); the unused "Cloudflare Agent Token" (26 permissions); app builds 5–9 in downloads (10–12 kept);
  downloads CORS now allows only the 3 sites + localhost. Added: monitor-only DMARC record.
- **Google sign-in, backend CORS, Sentry:** staging removed from the web client's origins and from prod's
  `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (prod redeployed: the API refuses staging); Sentry environments `staging` and
  `local-verification` hidden; the website's Sentry project accepts only the 3 sites.
- **Neon:** the empty `goawaygo-staging` database and role in the prod project; the unused default `neondb` and role in
  the dev/test project.
- **Better Stack:** the staging website monitor; the website monitor checks `goawaygo.com/home`; the status page logo
  links to goawaygo.com.
- **GitHub:** the empty `staging` environment and its 60 old deployment records; every environment now holds all of
  its own variables and only shared ones are repository variables (backend #90; the image build has its own
  `IMAGE_*`); the old repository-level variables.
- **Code and docs:** the staging site out of the website (#80) and app (#77: `env/prod.env`, Sentry `production`);
  `dev:dev-api` instead of the staging API; package name `goawaygo-web`; LINKS, FOUNDATIONS, RELEASING, ROADMAP,
  **Conventions and decisions** (README), deployment docs updated.
- **This PC:** stray `dbg.png`, `backend/Artifact`, `backend/Enabling`.

- **Accounts (signed in by the owner):** GitHub app "Cloudflare Workers and Pages" uninstalled and its authorization
  revoked; PostHog project "GoAwayGo Staging" renamed "GoAwayGo" (same project and token; no authorized URLs, no
  integrations); Resend API key "goaway-staging" renamed "goawaygo" (same key; one domain, no webhooks); the last old
  backend repository variable `WEB_BASE_URL` deleted (the prod smoke test falls back to `https://goawaygo.com`).
- **KAYAK:** no portal account yet (sandbox only); nothing to clean. Its key stays for when KAYAK approves.

#### Still to happen

- The testers' installed app (build 12) still links to staging.goawaygo.com (now gone) for Privacy, Terms, Delete my
  data and shared plans; build 13 links to goawaygo.com and reports to Sentry as `production`.
